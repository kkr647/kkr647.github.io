0. Introduction For project one, I chose to play with Spotify data and Austin’s weather data. Initially, I choose the Spotify data because I was really interested in what all I had been listening to throughout the pandemic. In the data, I could see what artist I listened to on a certain day, the song I listened to, what time it played, and how many milliseconds I played them.</description>

      <description>#0: Data Description My project 2 data is a cross section of patients who visit a physician’s office and the emergency room. I chose this data because I thought the numerical data including patient’s age, sex, race, family income, office visits, ER emissions, hospitalizations and number of chronic illnesses would be interesting to manipulate. Naturally, I have certain biases of how the healthcare system works, and due to the large sample size (4406 observations), I thought this would be a wonderful way of measuring those biases.</description>
